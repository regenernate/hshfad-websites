        <h1>What I believe about horses:</h1>
        <p>Horses, like all living things, deserve to be treated with respect.</p>
        <p>They appreciate it. They'll even work for it.</p>
        <p>And if you do it right, they'll come to respect you, too.</p>

        <h2>A little more about me, Cynthia:</h2>
        <p>I've handled horses of all ages since I was a small child.<br/> It has long been my dream to use this experience to help horses and their riders.<br>I hope you'll give me an opportunity to work with you and yours.</p>
        <p>I'm open to engaging with almost any horse so long as his/her rider will commit to using the techniques we discuss ( and practice ) once the horse returns home.</p>
        <h3>What I believe riders should do: </h3></h3>
        <p>I believe that building a mutual trusting relationship is foundational to moving forward with any horse and in so doing you are laying the groundwork for an enjoyable experience each time you ride.</p>
        <p>This can be done by:
          <ul>
            <li>Learning how to become and stay grounded while riding.</li>
            <li>Learning how your horse communicates, and what indicators to behavior they exhibit</li>
            <li>Learning how to communicate with your horse, and how to tell if she/he's listening.</li>
            <li> as well as lots of other ways you'll learn working with me</li>
          </ul>
