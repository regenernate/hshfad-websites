        <h1>What horses mean to me.</h1>
        <p>To understand why you should bring your horse to me, you have to understand why I love horses.</p>
        <p>When I feel like the world is just too hard,
        <br />or when I can't stand the thought of speaking to another person, 
        <br />horses are there for me.</p>
        <p>They never judge and also they smell nice ...</p>

        <h3>Now, why bring your horse to me?</h3>
        <p class="bigfont">I've spent years watching and studying natural horsemanship techniques from some of the greatest alive today, and I've spent nearly as much time practicing these techniques on horses of all ages and mentalities.</p>
        <p class="bigfont">I have more to learn ... as I learn every day ... but what I do know is that I can help you to improve your relationship with your horse. And that's what really matters.</p>
